                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Pablo and I'm from Salta Argentina. I'm married to Soledad and we have three children, Jaasiel the older one, Elias the middle, and AarÃ³n the younger one.
                    I have been a member for 22 years. I was baptized when I was 23 years old and after that, I served a mission in Provo Utah between 2005 and 2007.
                    Actually, I am working as a stake president on the Salta Oeste Stake. We have a lot of work to do but the blessings are a lot too.
                    About my job, I am the clerical leader in the Salta temple but I love programming, so that is one reason why I am studying at BYUI.</p>
